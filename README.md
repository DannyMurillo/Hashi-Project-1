## Group Project 1

--  [Daichan Restaurant](https://dannymurillo.github.io/Hashi-Project-1/) 

## Getting Started 

We approached a restaurant that one of the team members knew didnt have a website. We let them know about the class and offered to make them a website in order to gain some valuable development experience. 

###Prerequisites 

They required us to make a website that would eventually be taken over by their son. Making a website that was welcoming was the emphasis, one that was aesthetically pleasing without bragging. 

We went for a simple website with a parallax background to show movement without distracting the eyes of the user with the background constantly changing. 

At least 2 API's must be used. In our case we used Google Places, Zomato for reivews, and a Google form that would offer an interactive poll.

Firebase must also be used in order to store some sort of data input by the user. A firebase server was created and linked to the contact form that would offer users to comment on their expereince or suggest what they might think could have made their dining experience better. 

## Iterations

The short time constraint did not allow us to perfect the website as we would have liked but the MVP was more close to being complete than minimal. 

The menu section was the part of the website that had the most iterations. The menu went through about three iterations total to perfect how it looked and to make sure that it held its aesthetics from all viewing devices. 

### Future Plans

We hope to perfect the site before handing over the reings to the son of the owners. We would like to polish up some of the code and potentially tweak a few parts here and there. Add a download as PDF for the menu and add a bit more to both API's used.
